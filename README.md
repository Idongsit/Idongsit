- 👋 Hi, I’m @Idongesit
- 👀 I’m interested in marine data science, applied data science, computational chemistry, simulations, fish stock assessment, topic modeling, machine learning, and computer vision.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to leverage computer vision for smart data collection in marine environments.
- 💞️ I’m happy to collaborate on interdisciplinary projects involving applied machine learning and AI.
